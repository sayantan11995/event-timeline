Is varna dharma fully performed if a man belonging to one varna desists from dining with those belonging to a different varna and from contracting marriage relations with people of a different varna? The reason which led me to address the letter is that I apprehend that hasty reformers will force by legislation, temple-entry and such like reforms down the throats of the orthodox Hindus of India who are voiceless, not being represented in the R.T.C. or the Legislative Councils. Subsequently came your declaration published in The Times of India, that if you had the power you would make it an offence under the Penal Code for anyone to refuse to touch the Harijans. This was the last straw that broke the back of my silence and I at once addressed a letter on the subject to Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, President, 3rd R.T.C., requesting him to introduce a section in the new Constitution like the one existing in the present Government of India Act, prohibiting future legislatures from passing any laws forcing reforms in religious and socio-religious matters.'},

Textile machinery is based on the design of the spinning-wheel. Now about your diet. Your diet can consist of thin chapati, green vegetables and milk. Equally important is the point about pulses. I have myself eaten lots of raw onions. That is why I had written to Narandas two or three months ago that he should make arrangements for the weaving of fine yarn. The art of Yajnik sewing is not for making available to the poor readymade khadi garments, but for quick disposal of the khadi woven by the poor without loss. It is for making expensive-looking khadi inexpensive. Raw onion can do you good, but it can be taken only in the evening because I know that it gives off a terrible smell. Hence you should convince the ladies who have protested that they should feel gratified that they adorned the khadi woven by the poor by stitching it free and serving the poor. For, by their action, the stitched garments could be sold at the price of unwashed khadi and we could pay the poor their full wages.'},

I leave aside the pain which the baby suffers in the mother's womb before birth. Among the green vegetables, gourd, pumpkin, the different kinds of edible leaves, cabbage, cauliflower, tender bean-pods and brinjal are considered good. Some experiments being made in America indicate that a meal should not consist of a variety of articles. Fruit has the most nourishing value if it is eaten alone, and the best practice is to eat it when the stomach is empty. Our first meal, therefore, should consist only of fruit, though there would be no harm if it is preceded by a glass of warm water the first thing in the morning. If you can get permission to live all the twenty-four hours of the day in open air, it would be worth while to secure it. Even after knowing all the facts about your health, I adhere to the view which I have expressed.

DOYLE, Your communication regarding my request 2 for a definition of Government policy about my interviewing friends and carrying on correspondence in the matter of untouchability and another matter was read to me by Major Bhandari this morning. According to the communication, "Government are prepared to allow me a reasonable number of interviews (with persons approved by them)", and to carry on correspondence, "provided it is clearly understood that it is not reproduced in the Press". I add that my son out of nobility of his nature wrote a gentlemanly letter to Mr. Hudson regretting that Maulana Shaukat Ali had published his conversation with him in spite of his caution. Moreover, so far as a temple in the South is concerned, I might be obliged to join Sjt. Kelappan in his fast, if by or before the 2nd of January next that temple is not opened to the so-called untouchables. Three weeks 1 Vide p. 265. 288 LETTER TO E. E. DOYLE 289 have already passed without my being able to do much work, apart from being permitted after long delay to send two telegrams. 1 Bombay Secret Abstracts, Home Department, Special Branch, File No. 3864 1 On receipt of the letter, Home Department telegraphed to Bombay Government on November 1: "Your letter of 28th October forwarding important letters of Gandhi, dated 18th and 24th October, reached us only yesterday. We are after full consideration recommending to His Majesty\'s Government that Gandhi should be allowed complete freedom in regard to visitors and correspondence on matters strictly confined to removal of untouchability and that there should be no restriction on publicity. Naturally these interviews and correspondence should have no reference to civil disobedience and must be strictly limited to the removal of untouchability. And as a preliminary, I shall deny myself all the feeding facilities permitted to me and restrict myself to such \'C\' class diet as I can within my vow consistently take and so long as my body can accommodate itself to such food. If the warning read out to me at the interview with Dr. Ambedkar was by way of punishment for what I am alleged to have done regarding the telegram to Maulana Shaukat Ali, common justice even to a prisoner demanded that the cause of the punishment should have been conveyed to me at the time of the warning, and before the punishment was pronounced explanation should have been called for from me. Let me say that my son told me definitely in official presence that Mr. Hudson had in a generous manner not only quickly granted him permission to see me as often as he liked but that he had permitted him to talk to me about anything and carry any messages from me, so long as he gave no interviews to the Press 1 Vide pp. In view of this conversation I saw nothing wrong in asking my son to tell Mr. Shaukat Ali that I had seen his wire and that I had replied to it, and that he was likely to receive the reply in the course of a day or two, the delay being due to the fact that it had gone to the Government for being passed.'},

  title: "March 11, 1932: But I hold that separate electorate is harmful for them and for Hinduism, whatever it may be from a purely political standpoint. To appreciate the harm that separate electorates would do to them, one has to know how they are distributed amongst the so-called caste Hindus, and how dependent they are on the latter. You will have to appreciate my feelings in this matter by remembering that I have been interested in the condition of these classes from my boyhood and have more than once staked my all for their sake. I regard myself by nature a democrat. Civil resistance therefore has been conceived to be a proper substitute for physical force to be used wherever generally the latter is held necessary or justifiable. I am painfully conscious of the fact that such a step whilst I am a prisoner must cause grave embarrassment to His Majesty's Government and that it will be regarded by many as highly improper on the part of one holding my position to introduce into the political field methods which they would describe as hysterical, if not much worse. LETTER TO SIR SAMUEL HOARE March 11, 1932 2 DEAR SIR SAMUEL, You will perhaps recollect that at the end of my speech 3 at the Round Table Conference when the minorities' claim was presented, I had said that I should resist with my life the grant of separate electorate to the Depressed Classes. Of course Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Mahadev Desai, who has just been sent to join us, know all about it. Both English and Indian officials are being brutalized. The latter, high and low, are becoming demoralized by reason of the Government rewarding as meritorious, disloyalty to the people and inhuman conduct towards their own kith and kin. The latter are being cowed down. Free speech has been stifled. Women who have come out for public service stand in fear of their honour being insulted. And all this, as it seems to me, is being done in order to crush the spirit of freedom which the Congress represents. Repression is not confined to punishing civil breaches of the common law. I should favour everyone of their adults, male or female, being registered as voters, irrespective of education or property qualifications, even though the franchise test may be stricter for the others."},

You know that among the Parsis the women in menses are treated as untouchables for eight days. Do you know that about 80 per cent of the boys attending schools and colleges, who wear a white khaddar cap, do not visit temples even once a year; and most of them state that the sacred books of the Hindus should be thrown into the sea? Have you ever advised these boys to visit temples for darshan at least once a fortnight or a month? I take them in order of their dates. Generally all pray at least once every day.

They would not then have to go to the temples as beggars before caste-men. They will go, if they go at all, as fellow-Hindus, welcomed by an overwhelming majority of caste-men who would not consider themselves in any way polluted by the touch of the erstwhile untouchables. You will recall what I said in one of my previous statements that wherever the majority of the temple-goers are against the admission of Harijans those temples should not be visited by them, and where the majority was composed of reformers, the possession should go to them along with the Harijans and that the minority should build another temple for themselves, if they so choose; but in the course of argument with Pandit Panchanan Tarkaratna, I discovered a flaw in that proposal. 8 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI has to carry with it the consent to purification, again out of scrupulous regard for the religious sentiment of the minority.

The curds should not taste sour at all-the curds which we used to make by adding drops of lemon juice to milk would be the best. You should not drink the milk but sip it slowly. If you want to experiment with milk-diet in a scientific manner, you can do so only in the Ashram or in the neighbourhood of a dairy where we have a right of entry; it is only then that we can get fresh milk. I suppose you know that yogis mix crushed neem leaves in milk before drinking it. I think innocent eggs are laid by hen without having been inseminated by a cock. In fruit juice, you should have the juice of six mosambis or of one pound of fresh grapes in two parts. You should take about four pounds of milk or curds, and mix with it as much butter as may be necessary. Doctors believe that, like milk, butter too does no harm if taken by itself. Only our vaids 1 could have discovered a vegetable substitute for milk, but, lacking zeal for dharma, they made no such attempt. He should be convinced that no milk other than the mother's milk can be the proper food of a human being.

Can you point to any Rajput ruler following the Buddhistic religion, or to any Mohammedan ruler who had compelled the sanatanists to allow the untouchables to enter their temples? Even now you have no objection to take the food prepared in European hotels or by a Christian or a Mohammedan? Are you in favour of the priti-bhojans 2 in which even the Brahmins, Dheds, Bhangis, Chamars, Mohammedans and Christians dine together?

The inmates are under the vows of truth, ahimsa, celibacy, control of palate, poverty, fearlessness, removal of untouchability, swadeshi with khadi as the centre, equal respect for all religions and bread-labour.

The Ashram has 107 inmates at present (men 42, women 31, boys 12 and girls 22). This number excludes those who are in prison and those who are otherwise engaged outside. Up to now it has trained nearly 1,000 persons in the manufacture of khadi. 302 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI The Ashram is a registered trust. Experience has shown that so long as it remains a predominantly educational service (using the term in the widest sense) and not only charges no fees but actually feeds and clothes the learners, it cannot be wholly self-supporting. The Ashram owns immovable property estimated at about Rs. Hence, the civil disobedience campaign of 1930 was started by the march to Dandi of nearly eighty inmates of the Ashram. The statements that have come under my observation since the breaking of my fast show that 1. methods of torture have been adopted by the police in various parts of India in order to cow down individual civil resisters, 2. women have been insulted, 3. free movement of people has become almost impossible, 4. in many parts of India, village work by Congressmen has become all but impossible, 5. civil resistance prisoners have been subjected to humiliations and bodily injury in many lock-ups and prisons, 6. unconscionably heavy fines have been imposed and gross irregularities committed for their recovery, 7. peasants withholding revenue or rent have been punished in a manner out of all proportion to their offence, obviously with a view to terrifying them and their neighbours into subjection 2 , 8. the public Press has been gagged, 9. in short, freedom with self-respect has become impossible throughout the length and breadth of the land. 2 The two words "into subjection" are reproduced from Bombay Secret Abstracts.

I have had many and prayerful conversations with the inmates and they have, men and women, unanimously approved of the proposal to give up the present activities. Thus the khadi stock and contents of the workshop and the weaving sheds will be handed over to the All-India Spinners\' Association on whose behalf that activity has been carried on.

I am unaware of any sections of caste Hindus who are both economically and culturally worse than Panchamas, and if there are I should very much like to know their names.

LETTER TO HINDU CENTRAL COMMITTEE 293 7. Then the Committee goes on to say: It cannot be suggested for one moment that though the Congress has thrown itself whole-heartedly in favour of this agitation for the removal of untouchability and for temple-entry after the announcement of the fast of Mr. Gandhi, it has done any appreciable service for the economic and material uplift of the depressed classes. The Committee should know that it is not possible for the Congress "to throw itself whole-heartedly into the agitation". It is being carried on by the general Hindu population organized by the recently formed Servants of Untouchables Society. That Society invites all without distinction of party to help it to remove untouchability. In so far as the Congress itself is concerned, its Hindu members have a record for the service of Harijans which is second to that of no other similar organization. But the Committee goes on: If the call to join the movement for such uplift comes from persons who are pledged to temple-entry, the orthodox Hindus on their part cannot but view it with suspicion, especially when it is preceded by Gandhi\'s cry of "Leave the temple-entry to me". It was said in answer to correspondents who were impatient to offer satyagraha and adopt energetic measures for opening other temples. Kelappan and myself I said to the correspondents, "Leave the templeentry to me and go on with the other constructive programme of economic and educational uplift". The next sentence in the Committee\'s statement runs: If Mr. Gandhi and his followers will give an undertaking to save temples and other religious institutions from interference by the mixed legislatures of the land, we are willing to whole-heartedly co-operate with them. 294 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI I have shown repeatedly that the two Bills before the Legislative Assembly imply no interference with temples or other religious institutions. They seek to restore the status quo existing before certain decisions of law-courts, well known to the legal members of the Committee. With the sentiment expressed in the last two sentences of the statement of the Committee I can whole-heartedly agree, for so far as I am concerned there is no desire indiscriminately "to import Western ideals of society, civilization and equality". The movement against untouchability is on that very account deliberately circumscribed and restricted to the very things described by the Committee except temple-entry, and as to this last, it can be shown conclusively that there is no desire whatsoever to force temple-entry but by proper disciplined agitation to bring about a change in Hindu public opinion, a change not inconsistent with the spirit of the Shastras.'},

It has today the largest number of selfsacrificing men and women of unimpeachable character. Jawaharlal is their undisputed leader. I have, therefore, kept before me his great spirit. Nor by retiring at this critical juncture am I less true to Babu Rajendra Prasad who will in all probability be the President of the forthcoming Congress, and who unlike Jawaharlal shares most of my ideals and whose sacrifice for the nation, judged whether in quality or quantity, is not to be excelled. It must command the full support of all Congressmen who have no insuperable objection to the entry of Congressmen into the existing legislatures.'},

  title: 'January 3, 1935: Andrews will be able to give you firsthand testimony of what he saw and learnt in Bengal. In my opinion, if the withdrawal comes even at the last moment, it will be a blessing both for England and India, for the simple reason that persistence in the measure in the face of an almost unanimous Indian opposition to it would mean an unbending attitude on the part of the British Parliament and utter contempt for Indian public opinion. Sastri, who was at one time a persona grata at the India Office whose complete confidence he enjoyed, and the equally bitter comment of Hon. C. Y. Chintamani, who has been regarded as a moderate among moderates and who has, in season and out of season, condemned the Congress attitude in unmeasured language. The contemptuous dismissal of that Memorandum, beyond a mere courteous reference to it, has extorted the following remark from Sastri: No, Sir, it is impossible for the Liberal Party to give an atom of cooperation. It received Royal assent and became an Act on August 2, 1935. It is their honest belief that British rule in India has been, on the whole, for her good. I have retired from the Congress because, among other reasons, I want to impose silence upon myself, so far as it is humanly possible, about the political measures of the Government. Even the control over the 20 per cent proposed to be left in the hands of the Finance Minister is subject to suspension by the Governor-General. Responsible Ministers have no right even to transfer any member, either of the all-India service or of the provincial service. British exploitation is made firmer than ever. Andrews 1 M. V. Abhyankar died on January 2, 1935. To clinch the whole of the objections, it is well to remember that the constitution is sought to be imposed upon the people who are already groaning under repression, such as, perhaps, has not been equalled in British Indian history. A strange confirmation of this comes from Dr. Maude Royden who is reported to have said at Karachi that the people in England knew nothing, through the daily Press or otherwise, of the amazing things which she heard during the two or three days she found herself amongst the very sober women of India.'}
